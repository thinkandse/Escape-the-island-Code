# Escape-the-island-Code
This was for a school project.
<br>
Might add files if it gets too crowded!
<br>
.cs files are ones I made, .meta are there automatically
<br>
SimplePlayerController.cs is the player-controller!

  Files that were not used:

  Hour 1: Fixing random errors.
</h2>
<br>
<h4>
  When I opened this project, it had tons of errors that I didn't know existed, I spent the whole hour trying to fix it, I fixed it but the game is unplayable.
